            <p>Q:What is Spritelink?<br />A: In case you didn't look at the front page *rolls eyes*, Spritelink is the connection between freelancers and employers in the Louisville area! It allows you to hire locally, advertise locally, and network locally. Keeping it all in the city.</p>
            <p>Q: How do I sign up?<br />A: You see the button labeled "Get Started"? Yeah, go there.</p>
  			<p>Q: What is the logo supposed to mean?<br />A: We just liked it. It was done by one of our freelancers ;) </p>
  			<p>Q: Is signing up free?<br />A: Is anything really free? Anyway, yes, signing up is free for customers AND freelancers...so I guess somethings are free.</p>
            <p>Q: How do I get paid?<br />A: You and the employer will agree upon a price for the work done. Keep in mind that Spritelink does take a portion of the sale. It can be done over PayPal, or you can link a bank account so the money will be deposited into the account directly. </p>
			<p>Q: Who do I contact if I have any questions? <br />A: We have a customer service line listed on the "Contact Us" page. Questions can be directed to them and them only since we don't want to deal with it.</p>
            <p>Q: How do I get on the top freelancers list?<br />
              A: You have to become the top freelancer, duh. The top freelancers are conducted by a very sophisticated equation to determine their positions, i.e., how they are rated by the employer, how many people save the freelancer's business card, and how many times they are hired.</p>
            <p>Q: Do I have to be both a customer and freelancer?<br />A: Power to you if you are, but no you do not have to be both.</p>
            <p>Q: What kind of freelancers are even on Spritelink?<br />A: Any and all kinds of freelancers are on our site. The only requirements are that you live in the Louisville area.</p>
